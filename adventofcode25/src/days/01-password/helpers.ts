// valPart2 isn't always a number between -100 and 100, so adding 100 then doing the modulo 100 doesn't always give us back a number between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The dial turn number, which is arr[1], could be any positive integer. Write a function that normalises the input val back to a number between 0 and 99. For example, -5 -> 95, 106 -> 6, 235 -> 35, -269 -> 31
export const normaliseVal = (val: number) => ((val % 100) + 100) % 100;
